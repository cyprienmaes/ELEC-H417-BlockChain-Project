# ELEC-H417-BlockChain-Project

The blockchain network consist of 6 nodes and one authentication center.


There are two files, node.py and node_test.py, that can run as main.
node.py is a user interactive node through which the user can introduce
transactions.
node_test.py is a non-user interactive node. We can not introduce transactions 
through it but it prints the information about the blockchain.
